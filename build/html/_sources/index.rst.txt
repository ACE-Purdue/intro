Introduction:
=============
CyberInfrastructure (CI) plays a vital role in today's scientific landscape.
Investments in CI bring significant economic benefits across various sectors.
However, the field faces three critical challenges: a lack of skilled professionals,
especially in combining cybersecurity and machine learning; limited opportunities for
underrepresented minorities; and education falling behind the fast pace of technological
advancements like AI and large language models. Project ACE (Advancing CyberInfrastructure Education)
aims to address these challenges by providing comprehensive education and training to build a more
robust CI workforce. This effort will enhance defenses against cyberattacks, drive technological progress,
and support the resilience and advancement of digital economies and scientific research.

Project ACE's innovative approaches are highlighted in three key areas.
First, it integrates Machine Learning (ML) and Cybersecurity within CyberInfrastructure (CI) frameworks,
training students on secure design principles and advanced ML techniques to tackle modern cyber threats.
Second, it incorporates advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLM),
and experiential learning to bridge the gap between theory and practice, preparing students to apply AI
creatively in various CI contexts. Lastly, it lays the groundwork for future CI workforce development
through a scalable and adaptable educational framework that meets current technological needs and adapts
to future advancements. The project's success will enhance the security and resilience of CyberInfrastructure (CI)
across various sectors by democratizing access to CI resources and education, particularly for underrepresented
groups, including those at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Furthermore, a cooperative
network of educators, industry experts, and policymakers will foster the growth of a dynamic and innovative
CI workforce ecosystem.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
